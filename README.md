# Bagels Game

This is a game that tests your IQ by generating a four digit code and your task is to guess it with a maximum of 10 tries.
After each wrong guess made feedback is given to you, as follows;
BAGELS - digit isn't in the code
PIN - digit is in the code but has been placed in the wrong position
CORRECT - digit is in the code and has been placed in the correct position

For example:
ASSUMING THE RANDOM CODE IS 1562
(BUT THE CODE ISN'T REVEALED TO THE PLAYER UNTIL THEY HAVE GUESSED IT RIGHT)

Player's guess: 1234
Feedback: 1(correct), 2(pin), 3(bagel), 4(bagel)
Player then uses the feedback to make another guess, e.g. 1526
and so on and so forth

If a player fails to get it in 10 tries, they are asked whether they need more tries or not.
